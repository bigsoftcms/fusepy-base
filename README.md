fusepy-base
===========

A [fusepy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fusepy) filesystem lifted from
[here](http://www.stavros.io/posts/python-fuse-filesystem/) and enhanced with
documention from
[here](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~geoff/classes/hmc.cs135.201001/homework/fuse/fuse_doc.html).

The filesystem adds logging to every FUSE filesystem operation to help educate
you on the workings of a FUSE filesystem. Use this as a `CTRL+C`/`CTRL+V` starting
point for your actual filesystem.

dependencies
============

Your system needs to have FUSE installed on it.
